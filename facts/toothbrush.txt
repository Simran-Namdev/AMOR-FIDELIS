A toothbrush is a small, hand-held brush used for cleaning teeth and maintaining oral hygiene. It typically consists of a handle and a head with bristles made of nylon or other synthetic materials. Toothbrushes are designed to remove plaque, food debris, and stains from the surfaces of teeth and along the gum line. They come in various sizes, shapes, and bristle configurations to suit different needs and preferences. Regular use of a toothbrush, along with toothpaste and proper brushing techniques, helps prevent tooth decay, gum disease, and other oral health issues. Toothbrushes are an essential part of daily personal care routines and are recommended for use by dental professionals.
