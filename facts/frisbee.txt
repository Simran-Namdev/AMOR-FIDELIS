A Frisbee is a flat, circular plastic disc designed for throwing and catching as a recreational activity or competitive sport. It is made of a dense, rigid material and has a raised ridge or lip along its edge to provide stability and aerodynamic properties during flight. Frisbees are used for various games and activities, such as Ultimate Frisbee, disc golf, and casual throwing and catching, promoting outdoor fun, exercise, and skill development.
