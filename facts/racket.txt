A tennis racket, also known as a tennis racquet, is a stringed device used to strike a tennis ball during a game of tennis. It consists of a handle, a flat oval or circular head with strings tightly stretched across it, and a frame made of materials like graphite, aluminum, or composite materials. Tennis rackets are designed to provide power, control, and spin when hitting the ball, and come in various sizes, weights, and specifications to suit different playing styles and skill levels.
