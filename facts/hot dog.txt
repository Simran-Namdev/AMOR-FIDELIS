A hot dog is a cooked sausage, typically made from beef or a combination of meats, that is served in an elongated, soft bread bun. It is a popular street food and a classic item at sporting events, carnivals, and cookouts. Hot dogs can be dressed with various condiments, such as mustard, ketchup, relish, and sauerkraut, and are often enjoyed as a quick and satisfying meal or snack. They are a beloved part of American cuisine and are widely available from street vendors, concession stands, and backyard grills.
