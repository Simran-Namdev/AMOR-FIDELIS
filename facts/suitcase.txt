A suitcase is a rectangular, rigid container designed for carrying clothing and personal belongings while traveling. It is typically made of sturdy materials such as plastic, fabric, or leather and features a hinged lid, handles for carrying, and sometimes wheels for easy mobility. Suitcases come in various sizes, from small carry-ons to large checked luggage, and are essential for organizing and transporting personal items during trips or relocations.
