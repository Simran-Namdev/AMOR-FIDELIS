A bicycle is a two-wheeled, pedal-driven vehicle designed for efficient transportation over short to moderate distances. It consists of a frame, two wheels, pedals, a seat, and handlebars. Bicycles are powered by the rider's own muscle power, making them environmentally friendly and a healthy mode of transportation. They are used for recreation, exercise, commuting, and competitive racing, providing a convenient and cost-effective alternative to motorized vehicles in many situations.
