An umbrella is a portable canopy device designed to provide protection from rain, sun, or other weather elements. It consists of a circular or semi-circular fabric canopy mounted on a foldable frame with a handle. Umbrellas are held or mounted to shield the user from precipitation, direct sunlight, or light wind. They are commonly used as a practical accessory for outdoor activities and can also serve as a fashion statement or decorative item.
