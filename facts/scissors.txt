Scissors are a hand-operated cutting instrument consisting of two sharp, pivoted blades that move against each other to cut materials. They are commonly used for cutting paper, cloth, thin plastic, or other lightweight materials. Scissors come in various sizes and designs, with different blade shapes and handle configurations to suit specific tasks, such as dressmaking, crafting, or household chores. They are an essential tool in many professions, hobbies, and everyday activities, allowing for precise and controlled cutting.
