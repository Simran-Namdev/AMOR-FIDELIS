A toilet is a plumbing fixture designed for the disposal of human waste. It consists of a bowl with a water-filled trap, a flushing mechanism, and a cistern or tank to store and release water for flushing. Toilets are found in bathrooms and are an essential part of modern sanitation systems. They come in various designs, including pedestal, wall-mounted, and floor-mounted models, and can be made from materials like porcelain, ceramic, or stainless steel. Proper installation and maintenance of toilets are crucial for hygiene and environmental protection.
