A kite is a tethered aircraft made of lightweight materials, typically fabric or plastic, and designed to fly by catching wind currents. Kites come in various shapes and sizes, with a frame and one or more tails for stability. They are flown using a tether (string or line) held by the kite enthusiast on the ground. Kites are used for recreation, sport, scientific research, and cultural traditions, providing an enjoyable outdoor activity that combines skill, patience, and an appreciation for wind and air currents.
