A surfboard is a specialized board designed for riding on ocean waves. It is typically made of lightweight, buoyant materials like foam or wood, with a sleek, hydrodynamic shape and fins for stability and maneuverability. Surfboards come in various sizes and shapes to suit different wave conditions and riding styles. They are essential equipment for the sport of surfing, allowing riders to catch and ride breaking waves, combining athleticism, balance, and a connection with the ocean.
