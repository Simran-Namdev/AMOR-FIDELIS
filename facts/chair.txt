A chair is a piece of furniture designed for a single person to sit on. It typically consists of a seat, a back, and four legs, though designs can vary. Chairs are used in various settings, including homes, offices, schools, and public spaces. They provide comfort and support while seated and can be crafted from a variety of materials, such as wood, metal, plastic, or upholstered fabrics. Chairs serve both functional and decorative purposes and come in a wide range of styles, from modern and minimalist to ornate and antique.
