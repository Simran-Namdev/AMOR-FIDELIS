A kitchen appliance used for cooking, reheating, and defrosting food quickly using electromagnetic radiation. Microwaves generate heat by vibrating water molecules in the food, making it cook faster than conventional methods. They are commonly used for heating leftovers, popping popcorn, cooking frozen meals, and defrosting frozen foods.
