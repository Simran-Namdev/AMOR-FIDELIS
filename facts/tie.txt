A tie is a long, narrow piece of fabric worn around the neck and knotted at the throat, typically as part of formal or professional attire for men. Ties are commonly made of silk, polyester, or other materials and come in various colors, patterns, and styles. They are worn to complement suits or dress shirts, adding a touch of sophistication and formality to an outfit while also serving as a means of individual expression through color and design choices.
