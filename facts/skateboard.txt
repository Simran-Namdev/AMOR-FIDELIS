 A skateboard is a flat, narrow board mounted on small wheels, used for riding and performing various tricks and maneuvers. It consists of a deck made of wood or composite materials, with trucks (metal axles) and wheels attached underneath. Skateboards are propelled by the rider's feet and balance, allowing for dynamic and creative movements. They are used for transportation, recreation, and competitive skateboarding sports, requiring skill, coordination, and a sense of adventure.
