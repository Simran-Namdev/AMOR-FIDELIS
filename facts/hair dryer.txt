A hair dryer is an electrical appliance used for drying and styling hair after washing or wetting it. It works by blowing a stream of hot air over the hair, evaporating moisture and allowing the hair to dry more quickly than it would naturally. Hair dryers typically consist of a handheld unit with a barrel-shaped nozzle, a heating element, and a built-in fan. They can be used for simple drying or for creating various hairstyles by using different attachments or techniques. Hair dryers are commonly found in bathrooms and salons, and are essential tools for personal grooming and hair care.
