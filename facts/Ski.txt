Skis are long, narrow planks made of wood, fiberglass, or other materials, designed for gliding over snow. They are used in various winter sports, such as downhill skiing, cross-country skiing, and ski jumping. Skis are attached to boots with bindings, allowing the skier to control their movement and navigate down slopes or across flat terrain. They are essential equipment for winter recreation, exercise, and competitive skiing events.
