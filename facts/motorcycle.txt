A motorcycle is a two-wheeled motor vehicle powered by an engine. It has a saddle-like seat for the rider and often includes a rear seat for a passenger. Motorcycles are known for their maneuverability, acceleration, and fuel efficiency. They are used for various purposes, including commuting, recreation, racing, and as a mode of transportation in areas with congested traffic or narrow roads. Riding a motorcycle requires special skills and safety precautions due to its inherent instability and exposure to weather conditions.
