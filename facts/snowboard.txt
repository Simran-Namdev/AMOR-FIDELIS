A snowboard is a single, wide board designed for sliding down snow-covered slopes. It is made of various materials, including wood, fiberglass, and plastic, and features a curved shape and edges for turning and control. Snowboarders stand sideways on the board, which is secured to their feet with bindings. Snowboarding is a popular winter sport that combines elements of skiing, skateboarding, and surfing, offering thrills, adventure, and a unique riding experience.
