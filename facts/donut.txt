A donut, also spelled doughnut, is a sweet, deep-fried pastry that is typically ring-shaped or in the form of a torus. It is made from a dough that is either yeast-leavened or chemically leavened, and can be plain or coated with various toppings, such as glazes, icings, or sprinkles. Donuts are a popular breakfast or snack food and are enjoyed for their soft, fluffy texture and sweet flavors. They come in various varieties, including glazed, jelly-filled, and cake-style, and are widely available at bakeries, donut shops, and convenience stores.
