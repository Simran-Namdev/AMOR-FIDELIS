A clock is an instrument used for measuring and displaying time. It typically consists of a circular face with numbered markings or digits, along with hour, minute, and second hands that rotate around a central axis. Clocks can be analog (with moving hands) or digital (displaying numerical time). They can be powered by various mechanisms, such as quartz movements, mechanical springs, or atomic oscillators. Clocks are found in various settings, including homes, offices, public spaces, and as accessories. They help people keep track of time, schedule activities, and maintain punctuality in their daily lives.
