A bus is a large motor vehicle designed to carry numerous passengers along fixed routes or for charter services. Buses typically have a long body with rows of seats and are equipped with features such as luggage compartments and accessibility features for passengers with disabilities. They are commonly used for public transportation in cities, intercity travel, and as a mode of transportation for schools, organizations, and tour groups, offering an efficient and cost-effective way to move large numbers of people.
