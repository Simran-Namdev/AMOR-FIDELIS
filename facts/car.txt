A car, also known as an automobile, is a four-wheeled motor vehicle designed for passenger transportation on roads. Cars typically have a gasoline or diesel-powered internal combustion engine, a steering wheel for directional control, and seats for the driver and passengers. They offer convenience, comfort, and the ability to transport people and cargo over long distances. Cars are widely used for personal transportation, commuting, and various commercial purposes, playing a significant role in modern societies.
