A vase is a decorative container, typically with a narrow neck and a wider body, used for holding cut flowers, branches, or other floral arrangements. Vases can be made from various materials, such as glass, ceramic, metal, or plastic, and come in a wide range of shapes, sizes, and designs. They can be simple or ornate, and can serve both functional and decorative purposes. Vases are commonly used in homes, offices, and public spaces to display fresh or artificial flowers, adding a touch of natural beauty and enhancing the aesthetic appeal of a room.
