A train is a series of connected vehicles that run on rails and are designed for the transportation of passengers, freight, or both. Trains are powered by locomotives, which can be electric or diesel-powered, and consist of various types of cars or wagons for different purposes. They are used for long-distance travel, commuting, and the efficient movement of large amounts of cargo over land, playing a crucial role in the transportation infrastructure of many countries.
