A bottle is a rigid, cylindrical container with a narrow neck and a closure, typically made of glass, plastic, or metal. Bottles are used for storing and transporting liquids, such as water, soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, and various other beverages and liquid products. They come in different sizes, shapes, and materials, depending on their intended use and the liquid they are designed to hold. Bottles are widely used for packaging, preservation, and convenient transportation of liquids in daily life, as well as in various industries.
