A potted plant is a plant grown in a container or pot instead of directly in the ground. Potted plants can include a wide variety of species, such as houseplants, herbs, small trees, or flowering plants. They can be grown indoors or outdoors, depending on the plant's specific requirements. Potted plants are popular for their ability to bring nature into living or working spaces, improve air quality, and add aesthetic appeal. They require proper care, including watering, sunlight, and periodic repotting or pruning.
