An airplane is a heavier-than-air aircraft designed to transport passengers and cargo over long distances through the air. It consists of a fuselage (the main body), wings, and engines. Airplanes are powered by jet engines or propellers and are capable of sustained flight at high altitudes and speeds. They are used for commercial passenger and cargo transport, as well as for military, private, and recreational purposes, revolutionizing long-distance travel and global connectivity.
