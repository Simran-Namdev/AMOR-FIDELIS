A dining table is a piece of furniture designed for people to gather around and eat meals. It typically consists of a flat, horizontal surface supported by legs or a pedestal base. Dining tables are often made of wood, but can also be constructed from materials like glass, metal, or stone. They come in various shapes, sizes, and styles to accommodate different dining needs and room layouts. Dining tables serve as a central gathering place for families and friends to share meals and conversations, making them an important part of many homes and dining establishments.
