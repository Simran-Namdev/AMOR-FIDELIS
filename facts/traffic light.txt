A traffic light, also known as a signal light or stop light, is a signaling device positioned at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, and other locations to control the flow of traffic. It consists of red, yellow, and green lights that indicate when vehicles and pedestrians should stop, prepare to stop, or proceed through the intersection. Traffic lights are an essential component of traffic management systems, promoting safety and efficiency by regulating the movement of vehicles and pedestrians at intersections and helping to prevent collisions.
