A baseball bat is a smooth, round, and long club made of wood, metal, or composite materials, used by batters in the sport of baseball. It is designed to hit the ball pitched by the opposing team's pitcher. Baseball bats come in various lengths and weights to accommodate different player sizes and preferences. They are an essential piece of equipment in baseball, requiring skill and technique to make solid contact with the ball and drive it into the field of play.
