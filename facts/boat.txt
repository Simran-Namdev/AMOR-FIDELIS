A boat is a watercraft designed for transportation or recreation on water. Boats can range from small, personal watercraft to large vessels capable of carrying passengers and cargo over bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, and oceans. They are propelled by various means, including oars, sails, or motors, and serve purposes like fishing, water sports, exploration, transportation, and commercial activities. Boats come in different types and sizes, adapted for specific water conditions and intended uses.
