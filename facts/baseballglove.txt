A baseball glove, also known as a mitt, is a sturdy, leather glove worn by players in the sport of baseball. It is designed to catch and field the ball while protecting the hand from the impact and velocity of the ball. Baseball gloves come in different sizes and styles depending on the player's position, with larger gloves used by outfielders and smaller gloves used by infielders. They are an essential piece of defensive equipment, allowing players to securely catch and quickly transfer the ball during gameplay.
